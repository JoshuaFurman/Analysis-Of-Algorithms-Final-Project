To compile my program please use the command:

g++ -std=c++17 -Wall *.cpp -o spidermaze

You can then execute the program with the command:

./spidermaze

You will then be prompted to enter the file name that you would like to read in
data from.

The output of the program will then be written to a file called:

output.txt

This file will hold the path from the start to end for each maze in the input
file.
